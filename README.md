# Microarray-Data-Analysis-by-R-

--This file includes the R codes for Affymetrix microarray differential expression workflow using Bioconductor packages.--I analyzed here a clinical microarray data set which compares the differential gene expression of inflamed and non-inflamed colon tissue in two disease subtypes.-- From the raw data CEL files I showed here how to import data into a Bioconductor ExpressionSet, perform quality control and normalization and finally differential gene expression (DE) analysis, followed by some enrichment analysis.
